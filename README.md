# PL/SQL Window Functions shema-gwizarobert - ShoeStride Inc.
Database development project focusing on window functions.

## Overview
This project demonstrates mastery of PL/SQL window functions through a realistic business scenario for ShoeStride Inc., a retail shoe company based in Rwanda. The analysis leverages Oracle Database Express Edition to implement analytical queries, documented in this GitHub repository, to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

## Step 1: Problem Definition
### Business Context
ShoeStride Inc. is a retail shoe company operating in the sales department within the footwear industry, with branches across Kigali, Butare, and Musanze.

### Data Challenge
The company faces challenges with inconsistent sales across different shoe categories and regions, leading to overstock in some areas and stockouts in others. Sales data is not well-organized, making it difficult to identify seasonal trends or customer buying patterns effectively.

### Expected Outcome
The analysis aims to provide insights for optimizing inventory by identifying top-selling shoe models per region and informing marketing strategies by segmenting customers based on purchase behavior. This will help reduce overstock by 15% and target high-value customers with tailored promotions.

## Step 2: Success Criteria
The project defines the following five measurable goals to address the business problem:
1. Identify the top 5 shoe models per region/quarter using RANK().
2. Calculate running monthly sales totals for shoes with SUM() OVER().
3. Determine month-over-month growth in shoe sales using LAG()/LEAD().
4. Segment customers into quartiles based on shoe purchase frequency with NTILE(4).
5. Compute 3-month moving averages for shoe category sales using AVG() OVER().

## Step 6: Results Analysis
### Descriptive - What Happened?
The analysis revealed that sneaker sales peaked in the second quarter of 2024, particularly in Kigali, while boot sales showed steady growth in Musanze. Outliers included unusually high transactions for sandals in July 2024, suggesting a seasonal spike.

### Diagnostic - Why?
This pattern likely stems from seasonal demand, with sneakers gaining popularity during warmer months and boots during cooler periods in Musanze. Marketing campaigns in urban areas like Kigali may have influenced the sneaker surge, while rural demand drove boot sales.

### Prescriptive - What Next?
To capitalize on these trends, ShoeStride should increase sneaker stock by 20% in Kigali for the next warm season and boost boot inventory in Musanze. Additionally, launching targeted ads for frequent buyers in the top quartile could enhance customer retention.
