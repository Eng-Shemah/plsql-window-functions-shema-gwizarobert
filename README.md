# PL/SQL Window Functions - Shoe Store Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a shoe retail business's sales data using PL/SQL window functions in Oracle Database Express Edition.

## Business Problem
The shoe store, operating across multiple regions in Rwanda (Kigali, Butare, Musanze), requires advanced analytics to understand product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. The analysis addresses inventory optimization, customer segmentation, and revenue forecasting challenges for their diverse footwear catalog including sneakers, boots, and sandals.

### Business Context
This specialty shoe retailer manages daily operations including product inventory across multiple categories (Sneakers, Boots, Sandals), customer transactions across different regions, and sales analysis. The store needs better insights into their business performance to make data-driven decisions about inventory management and customer service improvements.

### Data Challenge
The shoe store struggles to identify which products perform best during different periods, understand customer purchasing patterns across regions, and track sales trends over time. Management needs analytical capabilities to compare performance across different time periods and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

### Expected Outcome
The analysis will provide actionable insights including identification of top-spending customers, product category performance patterns, revenue trends with running totals, and customer segmentation for targeted marketing campaigns. This will enable better inventory planning and personalized customer engagement strategies.

## Database Schema

The solution implements three interconnected tables:
- **customers**: Stores customer information including name and region (customer_id as PK)
- **products**: Contains product catalog with shoe categories and pricing data (product_id as PK)
- **transactions**: Records all sales transactions linking customers and products with sale dates and amounts (transaction_id as PK, with FKs to customers and products)

### Sample Data Overview
- **10 customers** across three regions: Kigali, Butare, and Musanze
- **10 products** spanning three categories: Sneakers (5), Boots (3), and Sandals (2)
- **10 transactions** from January 2024 to October 2024
- Transaction amounts ranging from 15,000 RWF to 50,000 RWF

## Success Criteria

1. **Customer revenue ranking** → Using ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() to identify top customers
2. **Running monthly sales totals** → Using SUM() OVER() to track revenue accumulation
3. **Month-over-month growth** → Using LAG()/LEAD() to identify sales trends
4. **Customer quartiles** → Using NTILE(4) for customer segmentation
5. **3-month moving averages** → Using AVG() OVER() to smooth seasonal variations

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Ranking Functions
- Identified top-spending customers using RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER()
- Analyzed customer value with PERCENT_RANK() for segmentation
- Determined revenue leaders for loyalty program targeting

**Key Finding**: Rankings reveal distinct customer tiers with top customers showing significantly higher purchase values, ideal for premium marketing campaigns

### 2. Aggregate Window Functions
- Calculated running sales totals for cash flow analysis
- Generated 3-month moving averages to identify trends
- Compared ROWS vs RANGE frame specifications for precise trend analysis
- Tracked MIN and MAX values to date for performance benchmarking

**Key Finding**: Running totals show cumulative revenue growth with seasonal fluctuations visible through 3-month averages, indicating potential restocking opportunities

### 3. Navigation Functions
- Computed month-over-month growth rates using LAG()
- Analyzed sales momentum with LEAD() for forward-looking insights
- Tracked percentage changes in monthly revenue
- Identified growth patterns and seasonal trends

**Key Finding**: Month-over-month analysis reveals sales growth patterns that can inform marketing timing and inventory planning decisions

### 4. Distribution Functions
- Segmented customers into quartiles using NTILE(4)
- Evaluated customer distribution with CUME_DIST()
- Created customer segments for targeted marketing
- Identified high-value customer groups

**Key Finding**: Top quartile customers represent prime candidates for loyalty programs and premium product offerings, with cumulative distribution showing concentration of spending power

### 5. Moving Averages
- Calculated 3-month moving averages for transaction amounts
- Smoothed out short-term fluctuations to identify true trends
- Used ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW frame specification
- Tracked daily sale patterns over time

**Key Finding**: Moving averages indicate gradual increase in transaction amounts from early 2024, suggesting growing demand that supports expansion strategies

## Key Insights

### Descriptive Analysis
The analysis revealed diverse product categories with Boots commanding the highest transaction values (up to 50,000 RWF), while Sandals show lower average prices. Customer distribution across Kigali, Butare, and Musanze regions shows varied purchasing patterns. The average transaction value spans a wide range, indicating diverse customer segments from budget to premium shoppers. Monthly sales show consistent activity from January through October 2024.

### Diagnostic Analysis
Growth patterns show variable month-over-month changes as the business establishes its market presence. Customer segmentation reveals distinct quartiles with the top tier generating disproportionate revenue share. Product category performance varies significantly, with Boots and premium Sneakers driving higher transaction values. Regional analysis shows Kigali customers featuring prominently in high-value transactions.

### Prescriptive Recommendations
1. **Inventory Management**: Increase stock for high-value categories (Boots, Premium Sneakers) by 25% based on transaction value analysis
2. **Customer Retention**: Implement tiered loyalty program targeting top quartile customers with exclusive offers and early access to new products
3. **Product Strategy**: Develop promotional bundles pairing high-margin Boots with complementary products during identified growth periods
4. **Regional Expansion**: Focus marketing efforts in Kigali region where high-value customers are concentrated
5. **Marketing Focus**: Target second and third quartile customers with incentives to increase average transaction values and purchase frequency

## Technical Implementation
